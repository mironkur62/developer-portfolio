            <p>In short, it's attractive because it's cute and we are hard-wired to like cute things. It's addictive
                because
                it offers struggling people a form of passive escapism to a happy place. Anime and manga traffic in
                neoteny.

            <h2>They really value friendship</h2>
            <p>Of the core concepts discussed in anime, friendship is often one of them. Many shows place emphasis on
                how rare a truly good friend is, and this makes many anime nerds really appreciate the good friends they
                have.</p>

                <p>Ultimate fight and humor. I just haven’t seen any anime like this. Like the main character is a
                    little
                    out of zone and plot is biased to keep him under shadows.

                    Like most people don’t know that how powerful Saitama is , various things happen on that premise.
                    Although he is the most powerful hero and wants to fight stronger villains. Truly a binge worthy
                    anime.

                <p>Totally unique , fast paced and leaves a mark.

                    This is new setting and new story. You won’t have seen anything like this before , the feeling and
                    fast
                    paced plot.

                    Everything about this anime is worth remembering. There is a reason why this anime took the world by
                    storm and topped all the charts.</p>
